# Master-Mind
A re-creation of a code-breaking game Master Mind.<br />
More info about the game concept can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game) <br />
The project contains compiled demo Windows application under the name `Master Mind.exe`.<br />
More in-depth game description and gameplay is described in `game_rules.txt`

- This game was created for a C programming language course during my first year in University.
- It was written in C with the help of [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) to render graphics.
- Bonus: The whole project is just under 4MB, quite cool huh?
